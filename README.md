I present a fully fuctioning (upon sign up, then sign in) game of tic tac toe.
To create the game I used javascript, jquery, html and css.
My plan of attack started with figuring out the game logic, as it was what I was
least comfortable with. Following that I moved to event listeners and handlers,
and finally to the user and game API.

A lot of the problems I ran in to were solved with extensive trial and error,
and the help of google and others to help provide a different angle for
viewing the problem.

Problems that will be addressed in future iterations will be hiding everything
but the sign-up/sign-in buttons. As well as providing more in depth game stats
for the player, wins-losses-draws. Continued work on user stories. And finally a HTML/CSS makeover.
